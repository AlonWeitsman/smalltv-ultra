# Model: Smalltv-Ultra
Please check your MODEL before the update, or you may update the wrong one, and will not work properly!!!!!

We have different model but with the same CPU, so please take care before the update, please check your model and upload the Corresponding firmware,
or it will not work properly, and may make it diffcult to update back.

If the udpate return "Magic Byte" error, or not enough space, please check the md5sum of the downloaded file.

Some antivirus software will modify the firmware.bin file, you can close it and try again.

Thank you.
